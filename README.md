# SmartIPO
This project builds a blockchain-based Intellectual Property system on Ethereum to securely register, manage, and verify IP rights. It prevents duplicate registrations, records transparent ownership transfers, and ensures tamper-proof history. By replacing outdated centralized systems, it improves trust, security, and efficiency in IP management.
